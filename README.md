What is "CookClever"?
CookClever is an enjoyable cooking mobile application that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to judge the users cooking ability, and provides them with an overall score.
On top of being a cooking app that teaches the user how to cook and their nutritional facts, AI/ML is used to analyze user input photos of their ingredients cut out, and their final product.
Any applicable feedback is provided to the user both on their set up of ingredients and final cumulative work. A meal that passes awards the user in-game points and a "you have cooked" 
status for the meal. A meal that fails punishes the user by giving them fewer points, and a "you are cooked" status for the meal. Technologies used to make this project include Python,
Javascript, MongoDB Atlas, Neurelo, Google AI Studio, and GoDaddy. 

Why cook with us?
CookClever leverages Google AI Studio and Image Recognition to deliver a seamless and intuitive learning experience both new and experienced chefs.

Inspiration behind the Idea
On our first night of the hackathon, our team was amongst 80% of the crowd who raised their hand because they did not know how to cook. We quickly realized that this was a prompt and
issue we could address with the latest technologies today. 

What we Learned
Throughout this project, our team gained knowledge of creating a working backend with Python and Flask as well as using Neurelo to get our own working APIs. We also further developed our
front end skills and were able to try and connect our front end and back end.

What's Next?
Our next steps would involve fully improving our UI and functionality.
