### What is CookClever? 🍳

CookClever is an innovative web app designed to help people learn how to cook. It offers a wide range of recipes with detailed, step-by-step instructions to guide users through the cooking process. At each step, users are prompted to take a picture of their progress. Using AI, CookClever analyzes these images and provides tailored feedback to help users improve their cooking skills. Additionally, users earn points based on how well they follow the instructions, making cooking a fun and rewarding experience.
