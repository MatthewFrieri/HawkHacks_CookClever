Let â€˜em Cook is an enjoyable cooking mobile application that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to judge the users cooking ability, and provides them with an overall score.
On top of being a cooking app that teaches the user how to cook and their nutritional facts, AI/ML is used to analyze user input photos of their ingredients cut out, and their final product. Any applicable feedback is provided to the user both on their set up of ingredients and final cumulative work.
A meal that passes awards the user in-game points and a "you have cooked" status for the meal.
A meal that fails punishes the user by giving them fewer points, and a "you are cooked" status for the meal.

Technologies used to make this project include Python, Javascript, MongoDB Atlas, Neurelo, Google AI Studio, and GoDaddy.
